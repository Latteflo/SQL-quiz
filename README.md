# SQL Project: Diving Deep into Company Data with DBeaver

This repository documents a project involving the use of SQL to delve into and explore the data of a fictional company. The project involved using SQL to extract, filter, aggregate, and order data from a complex database schema to answer business-related questions and gain insights.

## What I Learned
- Enhanced my skills in using DBeaver for database management tasks.
- Improved my ability to search for and utilize SQL-related information from the web.
- Enhanced my skills in querying a complicated database schema to answer data-related questions.
- Gained practice in formulating and executing a wide range of SQL queries, from basic data retrieval to complex joins and subqueries.
  
## Project Overview
The mission was to uncover the hidden details within a fictional company's data. I used SQL to interact with the database and extract meaningful information.

The database contained multiple interrelated tables, including information about employees, products, orders, payments, and offices. Understanding these relationships was crucial for executing the right SQL commands and retrieving useful data.

## Quiz Completion
After exploring and understanding the data, I completed a quiz that tested the insights I gained from the data. This was not a test, but a tool to reinforce what I learned through the project. I was able to attempt the quiz multiple times, solidifying my understanding each time.

## Project Steps

### Here are the steps I followed in this project:

- Understanding the database schema: I examined each table in the database, grasped the information it stores, and identified primary and foreign keys and relationships between tables.

- Formulating questions: I identified interesting questions that could be answered with this data. These questions spanned various topics, including sales, employees, customers, and products.

- Querying the database using DBeaver: I used SQL to write queries that answered these questions. I used a variety of SQL commands, including SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, and ORDER BY.

- Interpreting the results: I analyzed the results of my queries to draw conclusions about the company.

- Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in SQL, database management, and using DBeaver, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future data analysis projects.
